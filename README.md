👋 Hi, I’m @memosiki

👀 I’m interested in a remote job as a Python Backend Developer. Django/aiohttp PostgresSQL/ClickHouse with 3 years work experience.

🌱 I’m currently learning Go for recreational purposes.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a project that either serves and manages user generated content or runs and validates
code produced by it's users as in an educational platform 
since such systems has been my main responsibily for the past few years and it's what I'm truly proficient at. Conciseness also.
